## Test Results Summary

**Total Tests: 91**
- ✅ **90 passed**
- ⏭️ **1 ignored** (network test)
- ❌ **0 failed**

## Coverage Highlights

### Well-Covered Areas (>80% coverage estimated)
1. **Retry Logic**: All retry scenarios, backoff calculations, and error handling
2. **Cache Implementation**: All eviction strategies, concurrent access, TTL handling
3. **OCSP Checking**: Request/response handling, status parsing, error cases
4. **Security Analysis**: Weak cipher detection, chain validation, all security levels

### Areas with Moderate Coverage (50-80% estimated)
1. **Certificate Chain Validation**: Basic validation covered, complex chains need more tests
2. **Platform-specific Code**: Windows/Unix specific paths partially tested
3. **Async Operations**: Sync operations well tested, async needs more coverage

### Uncovered Edge Cases

#### 1. Network Edge Cases
- Slow network conditions (partial data received)
- DNS resolution with multiple IPs
- IPv6 connectivity
- Proxy/firewall scenarios
- Certificate with very large SAN lists

#### 2. Certificate Edge Cases  
- Certificates with unusual extensions
- Wildcard certificates with multiple levels
- Certificates with non-ASCII characters
- Self-signed certificate chains
- Cross-signed certificates
- Certificates with future not_before dates

#### 3. OCSP Edge Cases
- OCSP responder timeout scenarios
- Invalid OCSP responder URLs
- OCSP stapling
- Multiple OCSP responders
- OCSP nonce validation

#### 4. Performance Edge Cases
- Cache with millions of entries
- Concurrent access with 1000+ threads
- Memory pressure scenarios
- Very long certificate chains (10+ certificates)

#### 5. Error Recovery
- Partial TLS handshake failures
- Certificate renewal during check
- Clock skew issues
- Corrupted certificate data

## Recommendations for Future Testing

1. **Add Property-Based Testing**: Use quickcheck or proptest for randomized testing
2. **Add Fuzzing**: Fuzz certificate parsing and OCSP response handling
3. **Add Benchmark Tests**: Measure performance of critical paths
4. **Add Integration with Real OCSP**: Test against real OCSP responders
5. **Add Stress Testing**: Test under high load and resource constraints
6. **Add Mutation Testing**: Use cargo-mutants to verify test effectiveness

## How to Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run with verbose output
cargo test -- --nocapture

# Run specific test file
cargo test --test retry_tests

# Run ignored tests (requires network)
cargo test -- --ignored

# Run with coverage (requires cargo-tarpaulin)
cargo tarpaulin --out Html

# Run benchmarks
cargo bench
```

## Continuous Integration

The test suite is designed to run in CI environments. Network-dependent tests are marked with `#[ignore]` to prevent CI failures due to network issues.

## Conclusion

The test suite now provides comprehensive coverage of critical functionality including retry logic, caching, OCSP checking, and security analysis. The tests ensure reliability and prevent regressions while maintaining good performance characteristics.
